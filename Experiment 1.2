Aim: Write a program that takes two strings representing numbers, converts them to wrapper classes, and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Code:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the user
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input the two numbers as strings
        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        String num1String = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        String num2String = scanner.nextLine();

        try {
            // Convert the string inputs to Integer or Double based on input type
            Integer num1 = Integer.valueOf(num1String);
            Integer num2 = Integer.valueOf(num2String);

            // Perform basic arithmetic operations
            System.out.println("Addition: " + (num1 + num2));
            System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (num1 - num2));
            System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (num1 * num2));
            System.out.println("Division: " + (num1 / num2));

        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            // Handle invalid number format
            System.out.println("Invalid input! Please enter valid integers.");
        }

        try {
            // For floating-point numbers, using Double
            Double num1Double = Double.valueOf(num1String);
            Double num2Double = Double.valueOf(num2String);

            // Perform basic arithmetic operations for floating-point numbers
            System.out.println("Addition (as Double): " + (num1Double + num2Double));
            System.out.println("Subtraction (as Double): " + (num1Double - num2Double));
            System.out.println("Multiplication (as Double): " + (num1Double * num2Double));
            if (num2Double != 0) {
                System.out.println("Division (as Double): " + (num1Double / num2Double));
            } else {
                System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
            }
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            // Handle invalid number format
            System.out.println("Invalid input! Please enter valid floating-point numbers.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}

Output:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Addition (as Integer): 15
Subtraction (as Integer): 5
Multiplication (as Integer): 50
Division (as Integer): 2
Addition (as Double): 15.0
Subtraction (as Double): 5.0
Multiplication (as Double): 50.0
Division (as Double): 2.0
